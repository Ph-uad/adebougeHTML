            According to Gordon Brown, former Prime Minister of Britain â€“
            <i>
              the world went through, covid, and the supply shock, then demand
              shocks, the shocks and aftershocks associated with the ongoing war
              in Ukraine, Gaza, and countless of other conflicts zone around the
              world but still was able to tame inflation to around 3%,
              unemployment in the US around 3.7% - thanks to AI.</i

            Michael Spence Noble Prize Economist from NYU says the world is
            about to experience productivity like nothing before. Companies
            should prioritize productizing AI in all aspects of production that
            makes sense while building a layer of hum control around it. The
            Markets agree, Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff
            Bezos, Tim Cook, Elon Musk, Srini Kunshik etc. have gone ahead to
            prioritize and pivoted their business structure accordingly. We plan
            to be at the forefront of bring AI to emerging markets.
